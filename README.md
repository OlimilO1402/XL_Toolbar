Project started in january 2023.  
This example shows how to implement a toolbar on a userform in excel.  
We have a class Toolbar and a class ToolbarButton.
On the Userform we have a Frame-control on the frame control we have some Image-controls working as buttons.
The class ToolbarButton holds and manages the image-control and paints it due to the users mouse-actions.
The class Toolbar just holds and manages the different ToolbarButtons.
